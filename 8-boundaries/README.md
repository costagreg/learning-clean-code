# Boundaries

## Using Third-Party Code
Providers of a third-party packages and frameworks strive for broad applicability so they can work in many envirnoments and appeal to a wide audiance.Users, on the other hand, want an interface that is focues n their particular needs.

Don't be afraid to use interface to tailored and constrain the needs of the applications. 

## Exploring and Learning Boundaries
Instead of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in our production code, we could write some tests to explore our understending of third-party code. Jim Newkirk calls such  tests learning tests.

## Learning Tests Are Better Than Free
Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investiment. When there are new releases of the thrid-party package, we run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.
