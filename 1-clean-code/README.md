# Clean Code

## There Will Be Code
To who says that one day we won't need programmers.
Nonsense! Each programm will always require a high level of details which you can acchive just with code.

## Bad Code
Bad Code can bring a company down.

Bad Code usually happens because we think that a working mess is better than nothing. 

We have all said we would go back and clean it later. Of course we didn't know **LeBlanc's law**: *Later equals never*.

## Attitude
It's the developers responsability to share any problems with the code.
It's about attitude. Never be afraid to share what we think.
It's our job to defend the code with passion.
So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of menagers who don't understand the risks of making messes.

## The Primal Conundrum
The only way to make the deadline is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

## The Art of Clean Code?
The bad news is that writing code clean code is a lot like painting a picture. Most of us know when a picture is painted well or badly. But being able to recognize good art from bad does not mean that we know how to paint. So too being able to recognise clean code from dirty code doesn not mean that we know how to write clean code!

In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.

## We Are Authors
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.
There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the surounding code. The code you are trying to write today will be hard or easy to write depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to read. So if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.

## The Boy Scout Rule

Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
