# Formatting

Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer's first order of business.

"Getting it working" is not the first order of business for a professional developer but communication.

## Vertical Formatting

Small files are usually easier to understand than large files are.

## The Newspaper Metaphor

We would like a source file to be a like a newspaper article. You read it vertically. At the top you expect the headline going through the bottom you get more details.
Details should increase as we go downward.

## Vertical Opennes Between Conceptes

Nearly all code is read left to right and top to bottom. Each line represents an expression or a clause, and each group of lines represents a complete thought.

**Those thoughts should be separeted from each other with blank lines**

Each blank line is a visual cue that identifies a new and separate concept.

Code is much more readable if separate thoughts by a blank line.

## Horizontal Formatting

We should strive to keep our lines short.
